% Projected trends in climate forcing
% suggest a need to increasingly focus on
% variability and extremes in ecological processes.
In ecological systems, extremes can happen
in time, such as population crashes,
or in space, such as rapid range contractions.
However, current methods for
joint inference about temporal and spatial dynamics
(e.g.\ spatiotemporal modelling with Gaussian random fields)
may perform poorly when
underlying processes include extreme events.
Here we introduce a model that allows for extremes
to occur simultaneously in time and space.
Our model is a Bayesian predictive-process GLMM
(generalized linear mixed-effects model)
that uses a multivariate-$t$ distribution to describe spatial random effects.
The approach is easily implemented with
our flexible R package \textbf{glmmfields}.
First, using simulated data,
we demonstrate the ability to recapture spatiotemporal extremes,
and explore the consequences of fitting models that ignore such extremes.
Second, we predict
tree mortality from mountain pine beetle (\emph{Dendroctonus ponderosae})
outbreaks in the US Pacific Northwest over the last 16 years.
We show that our approach provides
more accurate and precise predictions
compared to traditional spatiotemporal models
when extremes are present.
Our R package makes these models
accessible to a wide range of ecologists
and scientists in other disciplines interested in
fitting spatiotemporal GLMMs, with and without extremes.

\section{Introduction}

Applications of statistical models that allow for joint inference about spatial
and temporal dynamics have advanced rapidly in ecology over the last several
decades \citep[e.g.][]{bascompte1995, latimer2009, conn2015}. Spatiotemporal
models have also been widely used in other disciplines, including applications
to weather, remote sensing, human disease dynamics, and crime
\citep{cressie2011}. When ecological data are spatially structured, explicitly
accounting for spatial autocorrelation can improve model predictions and
inference about parameters of interest \citep[e.g.][]{shelton2014, thorson2015, verhoef2018}.

Including spatial components in statistical models involves extending models
that most ecologists are familiar with, such as generalized linear
models (GLMs) or generalized additive models (GAMs). Spatial relationships can
be included as predictors in models of the mean (such as in a 2-dimensional GAM)
or can be included in models of the covariance (e.g.\ kriging). Recent
extensions of these spatial covariance models include modelling spatial
deviations in GLMs as random effects (Gaussian random fields, GRFs).
GRFs represent a two-dimensional version of Gaussian
processes and define the expected value, variance, and covariance of
random draws from a multivariate normal distribution.\R{B6}
Examples of these methods in existing R packages include but are not limited to
\textbf{spBayes} \citep{finley2007}, \textbf{INLA} \citep{rue2009}, and
\textbf{spate} \citep{sigrist2015} (see~Table~\ref{tab:packages}).

A limitation of spatial models that use GRFs is that they may perform poorly
when data include extreme or ``black-swan'' events. Black-swan events refer to
rare and seemingly improbable events that nonetheless happen --- often with large
consequences \citep{taleb2007}.
Recent work has demonstrated the regular occurrence of such events in natural
and ecological processes \citep[e.g.][]{albeverio2006, ward2007, fey2015, anderson2017}.\R{B7}
When models describing a spatial process
also include an observation model, for example, anomalous observations may be
reconciled by increasing the variance of the observation error (rather than
attributing these to extremes in the process). Extremes in temporal processes
have been modelled using a variety of methods in ecology, typically by including
mixtures of normal and heavy-tailed distributions \citep[e.g.][]{everitt1996,
  ward2007, thorson2011}. More recently, the Student-$t$ distribution has been
proposed as a solution to modelling process variation with extremes, or
``black-swan events'', in population dynamics \citep{anderson2017}.

Several extensions of GRFs have been proposed to better capture extreme spatial
events, including max-stable or extreme value theory \citep{davison2012,
  davison2012a}, where quantities of interest include probabilities of exceeding
some threshold \citep{davis2008}. Other extensions of spatiotemporal models to
describe extremes include the use of multivariate-$t$ (MVT) spatial random
fields \citep{roislien2007}. Focusing on the latter, to our knowledge these
methods have not been applied in ecology, fisheries, or environmental sciences.

In this paper we introduce the use of robust spatial predictive models using the
MVT distribution, and provide a user-friendly implementation in our new R
package \textbf{glmmfields}. Using simulation testing, we illustrate that the
MVT model leads to better prediction (greater accuracy, more precision) when the
spatial process includes heavy-tailed events. As an application to real-world data, we
apply this model to data on mountain pine beetle (\textit{Dendroctonus
  ponderosae}) outbreaks in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.

\section{Methods}

We seek to allow for large deviations in an ecological spatial pattern over time
by extending spatiotemporal predictive process models to use a MVT distribution
instead of a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution. Below we describe the form
of the model as implemented in \textbf{glmmfields}, describe two simulation
tests exploring model performance, and finally describe the application of our
model to a data set of mountain pine beetle outbreaks.

\subsection{Predictive process models}

\citet{latimer2009} provide an overview of predictive process models for
ecologists. For large datasets, estimating spatial random effects at many
locations may be computationally prohibitive. One solution is to estimate a
spatial field as correlated random effects at a subset of locations or $m$
``knots'' \citep[e.g.][]{latimer2009, shelton2014}, where $m < n$, the number of
data points (Fig.~\ref{fig:didactic}).\R{B11} The location of the $m$ knots describing a random field can be
chosen via a clustering algorithm, such as the partitioning around medoids
algorithm \citep{reynolds2006}. Instead of estimating an unconstrained $m \times
m$ covariance matrix, a covariance function is specified \emph{a priori} to
model covariance as a function of distance. Our \textbf{glmmfields} package
allows for the isotropic squared exponential (Gaussian), exponential, and Matern
covariance functions; however, anisotropic functions could be included in the
future. Given estimated random effects at the knot locations and the known
distance matrix between the knots and observed data, the knot random effects can
be projected to the locations of the observations
\citep[][Fig.~\ref{fig:didactic}]{roislien2007, latimer2009, finley2009}.

As an example, the squared exponential covariance function models the
correlation between points $i$ and $j$ as $H(\delta_{ij}) = \exp
\left(- \delta_{ij}^2 / 2 \theta_{\mathrm{GP}} \right)$, where $\delta_{ij}$ is the
distance between points $i$ and $j$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{GP}}$ controls how steeply correlation
declines with distance (GP = gaussian process). For a given set of $\delta_{ij}$, large values of $\theta_{\mathrm{GP}}$
correspond to smooth spatial patterns and small values correspondence to wiggly
spatial patterns.
% --- the degree of wiggliness implied by a value of $\theta_{\mathrm{GP}}$
% depends on the scale of the $\delta_{ij}$.
The elements of the covariance matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ at the $m$ knot locations are
% TODO sigma^2?:
then defined as $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{ij}^* = \sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}^2 \exp \left( -\delta_{ij}^2 / 2 \theta_{\mathrm{GP}}
\right)$ with the spatial variance parameter $\sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}^2$ scaling the amplitude of the spatial
deviations and the $*$ denoting a symbol referring to the knot locations as opposed to
the sample locations.
Following \citet{latimer2009}, we can calculate the covariance matrix
$\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\left(\mathbf{W}, \mathbf{W^*} \right)}$
between the spatial random effects $\mathbf{W}$ at the sample locations \R{B12}
and the realizations of the spatial process $\mathbf{W^*}$ at the knot locations.
Given
$\mathbf{\Sigma^*}$, we can generate $\mathbf{W^*}$ by drawing
from a multivariate distribution (MVN or MVT) with covariance $\mathbf{\Sigma^*}$ and
projecting these to the data locations as $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\left( \mathbf{W},\mathbf{W^{*}} \right)}$:
$\mathbf{W}=\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\left(\mathbf{W},\mathbf{W^*} \right)}^{'} \mathbf{\Sigma}^{*-1}\mathbf{W^*}$.


% Here, we summarize the important features of these models and highlight how
% our new MVT model differs from the MVN version.

\subsection{MVT random fields}

Our model is essentially a GLMM with a spatiotemporal element described by a MVN
or MVT random field. We define the mean $\mu_{s,t} \equiv \mathbb{E}(y_{s,t})$
at a set of locations
in space $s$ and time $t$.\R{B13} We then define $g(\mu_{s,t}) = \mathbf{X}_{s,t} \bm{\beta} +
\gamma_{s,t},$ where $g$ is a link function, $\mathbf{X}_{s,t}$ represents a matrix of
predictors, and $\bm{\beta}$ represents a vector of estimated coefficients. The symbol
$\gamma_{s,t}$ represents the spatiotemporal process, described below.
The variance of the observation model depends on the
chosen error distribution (e.g.\ Gaussian, Poisson, or gamma).\R{B14}

Modifying the MVN spatiotemporal model to the more flexible MVT distribution
requires estimating the degrees of freedom parameter $\nu$. When $\nu$ is small
(say $\nu < 10$) the distribution has heavier tails than the MVN
--- meaning, extreme events are more likely (Fig.~\ref{fig:nu}). For most
purposes, the MVT and MVN are indistinguishable for moderate values of $\nu$
(say $\nu > 20$) similarly to the univariate $t$-distribution compared with the
normal distribution \citep[e.g.][]{anderson2017}. If $W_{s,t}$
defines the value of a random field at spatial location $s$ and time $t$,
then the spatiotemporal element $\gamma_{s,t}$ can be
made temporally constant (one field shared across time, $\gamma_{s,t} = W_{s}$),
independent at each time step ($\gamma_{s,t} = W_{s,t}$), or autoregressive so
that the spatial pattern at time $t$ is dependent on the spatial pattern at time
$t-1$ to a degree defined by $\phi$, ($\gamma_{s,t} = \phi \gamma_{s,t-1} +
W_{s,t}$).
% In the last case, we constrain the spatiotemporal autoregressive process to be
% centred on zero at each time step to aid interpretation and ensure
% identifiability ($\gamma_{s,t} = \phi (\gamma_{s,t-1} -
% \mathbb{E}[\gamma_{t-1}]) + W_{s,t}$). This lets the mean process be defined
% by the linear predictor ($\bm{X_{s,t}}\bm{\beta}$) while $\gamma_{s,t}$
% defines the spatial process and how it evolves through time --- potentially
% letting ``hotspots'' remain hotspots through time while keeping the means of
% the spatial process $\gamma_{s,t}$ stationary and centred on zero.

Our \textbf{glmmfields} package fits these models in a Bayesian framework. We
sample from the posterior distribution using the No-U-Turn Sampler, which is an
extension of Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), implemented in Stan
\citep{standevelopmentteam2016a, carpenter2017} and the R package \textbf{rstan}
\citep{standevelopmentteam2016}. This Bayesian approach has a number of
advantages. First, it lets us fully quantify uncertainty around all parameter
estimates and derived quantities (e.g.\ predictions, probabilities of exceeding
extremes). Second, the Bayesian framework lets us place weakly informative
priors on parameters to impose our existing knowledge of reasonable values and
to aid computation. In the case of the degrees of freedom parameter, $\nu$, we
bound the lower value to $2$ for computational stability and use a gamma(shape = 2, rate = 0.1)
prior, which has a mean of $20$ and a median of
about $17$ \citep{juarez2010}.

\subsection{Testing the recovery of spatial extremeness}
\label{sec:testing-recovery}

We used simulation testing to evaluate how well heavy spatial tails could be
recovered under various conditions. Our simulations included 50 data points (15
knots) collected at the same locations annually for 5, 15, or 25 years. The spatial
process was independent by year ($\gamma_{s,t} = W_{s,t}$) with $\sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}^2 = 1$
(the spatial variance) and $\theta_{\mathrm{GP}} = 1$ (the spatial correlation parameter).
% with spatial data locations drawn with uniform probability from 0 to 10.
We set the MVT $\nu$ parameter to 2.5 (heavy tails), 5 (moderately heavy tails),
or 20 (effectively normal tails). We then corrupted the ``true'' spatial process
with observation error, using a gamma distribution with a log link,
$y_{s,t}\sim
\mathrm{gamma}\left(\mathrm{shape} = a,
  \mathrm{rate} = \frac {a}{\mathbb{E}(y_{s,t})} \right)$, where the shape
parameter $a$ can be re-parameterized into the coefficient of variation (CV),
$a=\frac{1}{\mathrm{CV}^2}$. We tested CVs of 0.1, 0.6, and 1.2. The underlying
linear predictor $\mathbf{X_{s,t}} \bm{\beta}$ was set to zero to focus on the
spatial process. Therefore, the simulation of data $y_{s,t}$ simplifies to
% \begin{align}
$\log(\mu_{s,t}) \sim \mathrm{MVT}\left(\nu, 0, \mathbf{\Sigma}_{W(s,t)}\right),$\\
\noindent
$y_{s,t} \sim \mathrm{gamma} \left( \frac{1}{\mathrm{CV}_\mathrm{obs}^2},
    \frac{1}{\mathrm{CV}_\mathrm{obs}^2 \cdot \mu_{s,t} } \right)$.
% \end{align}
We attempted to recover $\nu$ by fitting a model that matched the process
generating the simulated data. We provide a full description of the priors
and joint probability distributions along with details of the MCMC
sampling for this and all other models in the Appendix S1.
% TODO: make sure that all priors are listed in the supplement generating the
% simulated data. We placed weakly informative priors on $\sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}$, $\theta_{\mathrm{GP}}$, and
% CV of half-$t$(3, 0, 3) (i.e. Student-$t$(3, 0, 3)[0, $\infty$]).

\subsection{Testing the advantage of allowing for extremes}
\label{sec:diagnosing}

To evaluate the consequence of assuming spatial processes are not present when
they actually are, we generated simulated data sets from a model with spatial
extremes (MVT) and compared the fit of models with and without extremes (MVT
vs.\ MVN). Specifically, we simulated data from the model:
$\mu_{s,t} \sim \mathrm{MVT}\left(\nu, 0, \mathbf{\Sigma}_{W(s,t)}\right)$,
$y_{s,t} \sim \mathrm{normal} \left(\mu_{s,t},
  \sigma_{\mathrm{obs}} \right)$,
with $\sigma_{\mathrm{GP}} = 0.3$ (the scale of the spatial deviations),
$\theta_{\mathrm{GP}} = 1.2$ (the spatial correlation parameter),
$\sigma_{\mathrm{obs}} = 0.8$, and 100 spatial data points.
We set the MVT $\nu$ parameter to 2 to represent very heavy tails.
The locations of the data, and the knots (15), were held constant through time
to enable faster computations.

To evaluate out-of-sample predictive accuracy, we withheld 10\% of the data
randomly (10 points per year) from the model fitting and then compared the MVT
and MVN models. We compared the root mean squared error between the
$\log(\hat{\mu}^{\mathrm{withheld}}_{s,t})$ posterior medians and the true
$\log\left(\mu^{\mathrm{withheld}}_{s,t}\right)$, the width of the 95\% credible
intervals (CIs) on $\hat{\mu}^{\mathrm{withheld}}_{s,t}$, and the difference in
the leave-one-out information criteria \citep[LOOIC;][]{vehtari2017}, a Bayesian
information criteria that approximates leave-one-out predictive performance
(Appendix S1).

\subsection{Mountain pine beetles in the US Pacific Northwest}
\label{sec:beetles-methods}

To illustrate real-world applications of spatial models with extremes, we fit
MVT and MVN random field models to a data set representing mountain pine beetle
outbreaks in the US Pacific Northwest from 1994 to 2014
\citep{usdaforestservice2017}. We rasterized the map into a 500 by 500 grid and
then aggregated this high-resolution grid into percent cover in a coarser grid
reduced by a factor of 25.
% This maintained a reasonable resolution while limiting the data size for rapid
% model fitting.
We modelled the proportion of finer grid cells affected by outbreaks per coarser
grid cell.
We excluded a small number of coarser cells without outbreaks
since we chose to fit this example with a lognormal observation model for
simplicity.\R{B16} An alternative, to include the zeros, would be
a beta-binomial observation model.
Since the proportion
affected was far from $1$, we can fit a model with a log link and lognormal
observation distribution.
The log of the mean proportion affected at location
$s$ and time $t$, $\mu_{s,t}$, is predicted by a year-specific random walk
defined by $\beta_t$, and the spatiotemporal process $\gamma_{s,t}$, with the
spatial process itself modelled as autoregressive:
\begin{align} \log(\mu_{s,t}) &= \beta_t + \gamma_{s,t}, \label{eq:beetle-mu} \\
  \beta_t &\sim \mathrm{normal}\left( \beta_{t-1}, \sigma_{\beta} \right), \\
  \gamma_{s^{*},t} &\sim \mathrm{MVT}\left(\nu, \phi \gamma_{s^{*},t-1}, \mathbf{\Sigma}_{W(s^{*},t)}\right).
\end{align}

\noindent We model the data, $y_{s,t}$, as generated by a lognormal
observation model with scale parameter $\sigma_{\mathrm{obs}}$: $y_{s,t} \sim
\mathrm{lognormal} \left(  \log(\mu_{s,t}), \sigma_{\mathrm{obs}} \right)$.

We used 20 knots to represent the spatial process
% TODO: make sure knots are correct
(increasing the number of knots did not substantially affect the results). We
compared the above MVT model to a Gaussian random field model. To evaluate
out-of-sample predictive accuracy we withheld 25 randomly selected data points
per year from the model fitting, for a total of 400 withheld data points, or
approximately 10\% of the data. We then compared the log predictive density for
the held-out data and the width of the 95\% CIs
% from the MVN and MVT models, and the leave-one-out-information-criterion
(details, including priors in Appendix S1).

\section{Results}

Under most scenarios we were able to recapture true values of $\nu$ with
reasonable accuracy and low bias (Fig.~\ref{fig:recapture},
Fig.~\ref{fig:recapture-factorial}). The number of time steps had the largest
effect on detecting low values of $\nu$. For example, the median absolute
proportional error between $\nu$ and $\hat{\nu}$ (median of the posterior) was
only \mapeTwentyFive\ with 25 time steps, minimal observation error (CV = 0.1),
and $\nu = 2.5$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:recapture}b). However, the median absolute
proportional error increased by approximately \mapeFifteenIncFold - and
\mapeFiveIncFold -fold when the number of time steps was reduced to 15 and 5,
respectively (Fig.~\ref{fig:recapture}b). Observation error did not
substantially affect the estimation of $\nu$ until relatively high levels of
observation error (i.e.\ CV = 1.2, Fig.~\ref{fig:recapture}c).

When the true underlying data were generated with spatiotemporal extremes (MVT,
$\nu = 2$), fitting a model without extremes reduced out-of-sample predictive
accuracy and precision (Fig.~\ref{fig:sim-performance}). The MVN model tended to
overestimate $\sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}$ (which controls the magnitude of the random field
deviations) to account for effectively fixing $\nu = \infty$ (e.g.\
Fig.~\ref{fig:sim-performance}a).
The out-of-sample RMSE (root mean squared error)\R{E1} was slightly higher for the
misspecified MVN model compared to a correctly specified MVT model (median RMSE
= \rmseWrong\ vs.\ \rmseRight; Fig.~\ref{fig:sim-performance}b). The out-of-sample MVN
model CIs were a median of \medianMedianCIWiderSim \% larger than the MVT model
CIs. The leave-one-out information criterion (LOOIC) correctly chose the MVT
model in \looCorrectSim \% of the simulations (Fig.~\ref{fig:sim-performance}c).
Separately, if linear predictors were included, we found them to largely
unbiased under the misspecified MVN model --- the effect lies in the random
field estimation and therefore the predictions in space and time.\R{B1}

For the pine beetle case study, the spatial model with extremes generated more
accurate and precise out-of-sample predictions (Fig.~\ref{fig:map-etc}). The
estimates of $\nu$ indicated heavy tails in the spatiotemporal process (median
$\nu = \nuBeetleMedian$, 95\% CI = $\nuBeetleLower$ -- $\nuBeetleUpper$,
Fig.~\ref{fig:map-etc}c). Advantages of the MVT model over the MVN included
greater log predictive density for held-out data (Fig.~\ref{fig:map-etc}d)
% smaller values of LOOIC (SE = XX),
and a median of \medianPercSmallerCIsBeetles \% narrower 95\% CIs. Predictions
from the MVT model demonstrate evolving hotspots of pine beetle infestation in
the US Pacific Northwest, with particularly strong hotspots in 2009--2010
(Fig.~\ref{fig:beetle-pred}).


\section{Discussion}

We have introduced a spatial process model that models random fields through
time with a MVT rather than MVN distribution. Through simulation, we demonstrate
the advantages of this new model: when spatiotemporal extremes exist in
simulated data, our MVT model has superior predictive accuracy and precision.
Using a case study on mountain pine beetle outbreaks in the Pacific Northwest,
we show that our MVT model produces more accurate and precise out-of-sample
predictions compared to a MVN model. Because the MVT model converges to the MVN
model and only requires estimating one additional parameter, we recommend
fitting the MVT model even if anomalous events are not thought to be present
\textit{a priori}.

Many ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic processes could generate
spatiotemporal extremes. For example, unmodelled animal movement such as changes
to the shoaling behaviour of fish with population density declines
\citep[][]{rose1999} could generate apparent extremes. Another possible cause
could be spatial climate anomalies. For instance, a series of abnormally warm
winters around 1990 led to a sudden northward shift in juvenile cod followed by low
abundance in the southern North Sea \citep{rindorf2006}. In southern
Australia, several weeks of extreme warm water temperatures led to the sudden
range contraction of a brown alga seaweed \citep{smale2013}. Heat waves can also
increase the likelihood of wildfires or disease outbreaks
\citep[e.g.][]{harvell2002}, which could generate spatial extremes through time.
Additionally, human-caused disasters, such as marine oil spills could cause
extremes in spatial patterns through time. In essence, the MVT random fields
model allows for unexpected and unmodelled events to occur and have less
influence on parameter estimates and predictions.

% For example, several weeks of extreme warm water temperatures caused a sudden
% 100 km range contraction for a brown alga seaweed species off Southern Australia
%     in 2011 [@smale2013]. In the North sea, a series of abnormally warm winters
%     around 1990 led to a sudden northward shift in juvenile cod and low
%     abundance in the southern North Sea since [@rindorf2006]. I think both those
%     examples for the discussion work well. I was also thinking about climate -
%     disease interactions as another mechanism. Something like this:
%     http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.91.8.1194 (it's human
%     health, but that's probably ok -- there's other examples for animals)


For our case study of pine beetle outbreak coverage, the MVT model provided
better out-of-sample predictive ability and greater precision compared to the
same model with a MVN random field. We did not link covariates, such as
temperature, to the mean response, but it is possible that their inclusion could
help explain the spatial anomalies. Importantly, our model is descriptive rather
than dynamic \citep{cressie2011}. A dynamic model would include mechanisms
governing the spatial evolution of the pine beetle outbreaks \citep[such as
available tree host size and quality,][]{chubaty2009}, and these types of
mechanisms could generate the extremes we observe with our descriptive model.
Alternatively, incorporating spatiotemporal extremes into a dynamic model of
pine beetle outbreaks might improve its predictive capacity.

Our associated R package, \textbf{glmmfields}, is designed to be familiar for
anyone who has fit GLMs in R, and includes flexibility for many features beyond
those described so far. For example, \textbf{glmmfields} can be used to fit
spatial GLMMs for data without a temporal component (Appendix S2). The package
can fit observation models beyond those included in this paper, such as Poisson,
negative binomial, or binomial, and can include numeric or factor covariates.
% In addition to fixed, independent, and random walk temporal processes, the
% package can fit exchangeable time effects constrained by a Gaussian
% distribution (i.e. ``random effects''). , and allows for flexibility in how
% the spatial process evolves (static field, fields modelled as AR1, fields
% modelled as a random walk, and independent exchangeable fields).
\textbf{glmmfields} includes familiar R utility functions (e.g.\
\texttt{predict}) and plotting functions for model checking. Furthermore, the
package includes a simulation function that can simulate data from any model the
package can fit, and a series of unit tests that simulate and fit all major
model configurations.

There are limitations to the approach we have described. First, spatial
predictive models require the selection of knots; too few may not characterize
the spatial field accurately, biasing parameter estimates. The spatial process
may also be poorly described by a MVT or MVN random field and be better
described by some other form \citep[e.g.\ see][]{conn2015}. While the MVT
spatial model is more robust than the MVN model, better predictions and
inference might be obtained by explicitly modelling the processes that generated
the extremes. Also, the MVT random fields model requires a sufficient number of
observations and sufficiently low sampling error to detect spatial extremes
(though when extremes cannot be detected, the model converges to the MVN model).

Our MVT spatial model uses a predictive approach to achieve considerable
efficiency over modelling a full covariance matrix describing all observed
locations. However, an important topic for research is to include sparse matrix
algorithms in spatiotemporal models of extremes. A recent advance to spatial
models with large datasets has been the stochastic partial differential equation
(SPDE) approximation to GRFs proposed by \citet{lindgren2011}. These methods are
accessible via the integrated nested Laplace approximation
\citep[INLA,][]{rue2009}, which allows for approximate Bayesian sampling of the
posterior without MCMC. Use of the SPDE-INLA approach has increased rapidly in
ecology over the last five years \citep[e.g.][]{illian2013, ono2016}, and is
significantly faster than other approaches, in part because of integration with
Template Model Builder through software such as VAST \citep{thorson2017}.
Regardless, the MVT random field model introduced here is already efficient,
accessible to a wide range of ecologists and environmental scientists through
the included R package, and allows us to improve predictions for ecological
processes with extreme spatial anomalies through time.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



% One of the biggest hurdles in identifying support for MVT spatial fields
% (small estimated df parameter) is using spatiotemporal data sets that have
% enough time slices to capture extreme events. [tie into sim results]. The
% ability to detect spatial anomalies in ecological processes may also be
% affected by the number or selection of knots, however our results show that
% spatial extremes can be identified even using a small numbers of knots. Like
% other state-space models, inference about spatial extremes may be corrupted by
% observation error (both the observation model, and magnitude). Our results
% indicate that spatial events can be identified with moderate to high
% observation error (coefficient of variation ~ 1).
%
% As complex spatial models have become more user-friendly, we expect the rapid
% use of spatiotemporal models to be continued. Examples of possible
% applications beyond bark beetles include to models of fisheries (cite Thorson
% ECE paper), applications to climate anomalies
% (http://www.pnas.org/content/106/Supplement\_2/19723.short), or to other
% disturbances - wildfires, oil spills, and disease outbreaks.]
%
% There are a number of features included in the 'glmmfields' package that may be
% useful to ecologists, but beyond the scope of this paper. Examples of features
% include the addition of covariates (numeric or factors), models for temporal
% processes (random effects), and flexible models for the evolution of the spatial
% process (a static field shared across time, fields modelled as an AR(1) process,
% or fields modelled as exchangeable). Like GLMs, we have also provided a range of
% commonly encountered discrete and continuous observation models to fit a wide
% range of data types.

\subsection{Posterior and joint distributions}

In this section, for clarity, we use the notation $[a|b]$ to describe the
conditional distribution of $a$ given $b$. We use bolds symbol to refer to vectors or matrices.
The joint posterior distribution for
the model in the section \textit{\nameref{sec:testing-recovery}} can be written
as:
\begin{equation}
  [
  \bm{\gamma}^*,
  \theta_{\mathrm{GP}},
  \nu,
  \mathrm{CV}_\mathrm{obs},
  \sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}^2
  |
  \bm{y}]
  \propto
  [\bm{y} | \bm{\gamma}^*, \mathrm{CV}_\mathrm{obs}]
  [\bm{\gamma}^* | \theta_{\mathrm{GP}}, \nu, \sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}^2]
  [\theta_{\mathrm{GP}}]
  [\nu]
  [\mathrm{CV}_\mathrm{obs}]
  [\sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}^2],
\end{equation}

\noindent where the parameters are defined in the main Methods section.
Importantly, we use parameters with an asterisk (e.g.\ $\bm{\gamma}^*$) to describe
the random effects at the locations of the unobserved knots, and parameters
without the asterisk to describe the projected random effects
at the locations of sampled data (projection equation in main text). The joint
probability is calculated over points in space $s$, and time $t$. Missing
observations or replicate observations for given points in space and time may be
present.

The joint posterior distribution for the model in the section
\textit{\nameref{sec:diagnosing}} can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  [
  \bm{\gamma}^*,
  \theta_{\mathrm{GP}},
  \nu,
  \sigma^2_{\mathrm{obs}},
  \sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}^2
  |
  \bm{y}]
  \propto
  [\bm{y} | \bm{\gamma}^*, \sigma^2_{\mathrm{obs}}]
  [\bm{\gamma}^* | \theta_{\mathrm{GP}}, \nu, \sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}^2]
  [\theta_{\mathrm{GP}}]
  [\nu]
  [\sigma^2_{\mathrm{obs}}]
  [\sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}^2],
\end{equation}

\noindent
and the joint posterior distribution
for the model of mountain pine beetle outbreaks can be written as:
\begin{multline}
  [
  \bm{\beta},
  \bm{\gamma}^*,
  \phi,
  \theta_{\mathrm{GP}},
  \nu,
  \sigma^2_{\mathrm{obs}},
  \sigma^2_{\beta},
  \sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}^2
  |
  \bm{y}]
  \propto \\
  [\bm{y} | \beta_{t}, \bm{\gamma}^*, \sigma^2_{\mathrm{obs}}] \\
  \times
  [\beta_t | \beta_{t-1}, \sigma^2_{\beta}] \\
  \times
  [\bm{\gamma}^*_{t} | \bm{\gamma}^*_{t-1}, \phi, \theta_{\mathrm{GP}}, \nu, \sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}^2] \\
  \times
  [\beta_{t=1}]
  [\bm{\gamma}^*_{t=1}]
  [\phi]
  [\theta_{\mathrm{GP}}]
  [\nu]
  [\sigma^2_{\mathrm{obs}}]
  [\sigma^2_{\beta}]
  [\sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}^2].
\end{multline}

\subsection{Prior distributions}

In the section \emph{\nameref{sec:testing-recovery}}, we placed weakly
informative priors on $\sigma_{\mathrm{GP}}$, $\theta_{\mathrm{GP}}$, and CV of half-$t$(3, 0, 3) (i.e.
Student-$t$(3, 0, 3)[0, $\infty$] where the parameters in order refer to the
degrees of freedom parameter, the location parameter, and the scale parameter).
In the section \emph{\nameref{sec:diagnosing}}, we used these same priors and a
half-$t$(3,0,3) prior on $\sigma_{\mathrm{obs}}$. In the section
\emph{\nameref{sec:beetles-methods}}, we fit our models with a normal(0, 10)
prior on the initial year effect ($B_{t=1}$) (i.e.\ mean $0$ and standard
  deviation $10$, not variance, following the convention in Stan), half-$t$(3,
0, 3) priors on all scale parameters, and a normal(0, 0.5)[-1, 1] prior on
$\phi$.

\subsection{MCMC sampling details}

For the models fit to the simulated datasets, we initially sampled from each
model with 500 iterations across four chains discarding the first half of the
iterations as warm-up. If the samples had not converged after this initial run,
we re-sampled from the model with 2000 iterations across four chains.
For the models fit to the mountain pine beetle data, we sampled
2000 iterations, discarding the first half as warm-up. We measured
convergence as a minimum effective sample size of $\ge 100$ and a maximum
$\hat{R}$ of $\le 1.05$) across all parameters.

\subsection{Simulation details}

In the section \emph{\nameref{sec:testing-recovery}}, we ran 100 simulations for
each parameter configuration.
In the section \emph{\nameref{sec:diagnosing}}, we ran 150 simulations.
We ran more simulations in the second case to smooth the model
comparison histograms in Fig.~\ref{fig:recapture}e--f.

\subsection{Model comparison}

We compared MVN and MVT models via log predictive density, $\Delta$ LOOIC
(leave-one-out information criteria), RMSE (root mean squared error), and
credible interval width. We calculated the log predictive density (lpd) for
held-out data as:

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{lpd} = \sum^{n}_{i=1}{\log  p(y_{i} |
      \widehat{y_{i}}, \theta)},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $y_{i}$ represents the observed beetle coverage response value
for omitted data row $i$ (representing a given point in space and time),
$\widehat{y_{i}}$ indicates the predicted response value, and $\theta$
represents estimated parameters. We display the distribution of these quantities
across MCMC samples.

The Bayesian LOO (leave-one-out) expected of out-of-sample
predictive fit $\mathrm{elpd}_\mathrm{loo}$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{elpd}_\mathrm{loo} = \sum^{n}_{i=1}{\log  p(y_i | y_{i-1}) },
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}
  p(y_i | y_{i-1}) = \int p(y_i | \theta) p (\theta | y_{-i}) d \theta ,
\end{equation}

\noindent is the predictive density given the data without the $i$th data point
and $\theta$ represents all estimated parameters
\citep{vehtari2017}. For computational efficiency, the LOO R package calculates
LOOIC using an approach called Pareto smoothed importance sampling
\citep{vehtari2017}. LOOIC is then defined as $-2\ \mathrm{elpd}_\mathrm{loo}$
so that lower values indicate increased parsimony.\R{B3}
We calculated $\Delta$LOOIC as $\mathrm{LOOIC}_\mathrm{MVT}
- \mathrm{LOOIC}_\mathrm{MVN}$.

We calculated the root mean squared error (RMSE) of predictions as:

\begin{equation}
  \sqrt{ \sum^{T}_{t=1}{ \sum^{S}_{s=1}{ \left( \log(\mu_{s,t}) - \log(\widehat{ \mu_{s,t} }) \right)^2 } } },
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\widehat{\mu_{s,t}}$ represents the median of the posterior of
$\mu_{s,t}$. Finally, we calculated the ratio of the credible interval
widths as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{
\mathrm{CI}_\mathrm{MVN}^\mathrm{upper} - \mathrm{CI}_\mathrm{MVN}^\mathrm{lower}
}{
\mathrm{CI}_\mathrm{MVT}^\mathrm{upper} -
\mathrm{CI}_\mathrm{MVT}^\mathrm{lower}
},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathrm{CI}_\mathrm{MVN}^\mathrm{upper}$, for example,
represents the upper 95\% quantile-based credible interval of
$\widehat{\mu_{s,t}}$ for the model assuming MVN random fields.
