# Code for 'Black swans in space: modelling spatiotemporal processes with extremes'

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/44626612.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/44626612)

This repository contains code for a paper introducing an approach to modelling
ecological extremes that happen jointly in space and time. Our approach
introduces and uses our R package
[glmmfields](https://github.com/seananderson/glmmfields).
