# Modelling spatiotemporal extremes in ecology

This repository contains code for a paper introducing an approach to modelling ecological extremes that happen jointly in space and time. Our approach introduces and uses our R package [rrfields](https://github.com/seananderson/rrfields) (robust random fields).

This paper is a work in progress and has not been submitted for review yet.
